Hello, 

Please find the pdf of my (truncated) master thesis which title is "Alzheimer's prognosis using a deep survival model".

As it was jointly realised with a team of GSK researchers, I don't own all the rights of both the thesis and the intellectual rights (=> https://dial.uclouvain.be/memoire/ucl/en/object/thesis%3A33188 the link is closed as you can see).

In a nutshell, we tried to couple neuroimaging with machine learning to better understand neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's has been taken as a reference due to its popularity and the amount of brain scans we can find. The overall goal is to accurately predict when a person will eventually fall into dementia, given its history with the disease.

The neuroimaging part consisted of the data collection, preprocessing, normalization etc... It is complete in the thesis. 

The ML part in the other hand was truncated. It is split into two parts:

  - First we tried some models from the survival analysis framework. The network is not doing the feature extraction here, only the classification/regression. So we came with our own feature extraction technique. 
  - Second, we investigated more powerful and recent architectures/models, involving self-supervised learning, domain adaptation etc.. to address the big disadvantage of working with (neuro)medical data : the low amount and the high dimensionality. **spoiler** this second part yielded the best results, and it had to be truncated in the thesis that I can openly present.

If you are interested to talk more about it, I would be more than willing to discuss it with you. I could also manage to contact the manager of the GSK team and ask if I can share the entire thesis, as it was released a bit more thean 2 years ago.

Regards,

Younes
